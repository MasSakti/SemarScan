## About
QR stands for "Quick Response."
While they may look simple, QR codes are capable of storing lots of data. But no matter how much they contain, when scanned, the QR code should allow the user to access information instantly – hence why it’s called a Quick Response code. The data stored in a QR code can include website URLs, phone numbers, or up to 4,000 characters of text.
